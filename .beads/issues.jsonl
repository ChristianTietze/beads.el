{"id":"bdel-5w1","title":"Milestone 1: Read issues from beads and display in interactive list","description":"Our first goal is to teach Emacs to run the Beats.el mode, Introduce that mode in the first place and in that mode list all issues from the Beats database. The database listing then shows in the table view the issue ID, the statios like priority, the kind of task it is, whether it's open or closed, and then also the title of course, but not the description. The description is reserved for the detail view display. So we have an overview and a detail view, and you get to the detail view by interacting with the overview, you're pressing return to essentially open the task in the viewer. Check out @docs/emacs-ui.md for how the UI works and @docs/beads-client-howto.md for the overall plan and approach","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-12-17T07:55:27.505205+01:00","updated_at":"2025-12-17T08:01:35.549062+01:00"}
